# Finance Tracker Personal Project
This finance tracker project was inspired from me moving away from Notion as a note taking app for classes. 

Originally I handled and tracked my finances using a template from the Notion Marketplace, but this was my opportunity to make it work for me.

It is a work in progress project, I am to make changes and work on it as time permits throughout my semesters and holiday periods.
